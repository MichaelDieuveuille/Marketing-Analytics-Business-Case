# ShopEasy SQL Data Cleaning & KPI Analysis
Executive Summary

This project focuses on data cleaning, standardization, and KPI validation for ShopEasy, an online retail business experiencing reduced customer conversion and engagement rates. Using SQL, I developed a robust cleaning pipeline across multiple datasets, enabling reliable analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Conversion Rate, Engagement Rate, Average Order Value (AOV), and Customer Feedback Score. This work demonstrates how strong data governance and cleaning practices form the foundation for actionable business insights.

Business Problem

ShopEasy’s online marketing campaigns were underperforming, with low conversion and engagement rates despite increased investments. The root challenge was inconsistent, incomplete, and duplicate data across customer, product, engagement, and review tables, which hindered the company’s ability to measure KPIs accurately and make data-driven decisions.

Data Quality Validation

Ensured referential integrity between Customer Journey, Engagement, and Product tables.

Conducted checks for mismatched keys and outliers to improve reliability of funnel analysis.

KPI Validation with SQL Queries

Built queries to accurately calculate Conversion Rate, Engagement Rate, AOV, and Customer Feedback Score.
